# 📊 Benford's Law & Chi-Square Visualization using Pandas (Stars Dataset)

This project is a mathematical and data analysis exploration of **Benford's Law** using a real-world **Stars dataset**. We used **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **SciPy** to verify the distribution of first digits and applied the **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test** to visualize and statistically evaluate deviations from the expected distribution.

## 📌 What is Benford's Law?

Benford's Law states that in many naturally occurring datasets, the leading digit is more likely to be small. Specifically, the number 1 appears as the leading digit about 30% of the time, while larger digits occur in that position less frequently.

## 📂 Dataset Used

We used a publicly available dataset containing information about stars — such as radius, mass, temperature, luminosity, etc. The dataset allows for analysis of naturally occurring numerical data that fits the assumptions of Benford’s Law.
